README file for GPLEX\GPLEX

Question:  What is different about GplexBuffers.cs, Parser.cs and Scanner.cs?

Answer:  
These three files are not part of the Source-Controlled distribution. 
These files are produced from specifications at the beginning of the build, from gppg.lex, gppg.y, 
and the embedded resources of gplex.
